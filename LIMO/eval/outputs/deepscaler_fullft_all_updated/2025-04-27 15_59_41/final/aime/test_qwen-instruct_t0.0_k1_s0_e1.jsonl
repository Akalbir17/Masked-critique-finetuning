I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the total time taken, including the time spent in the coffee shop, is 4 hours. Then, when her speed increases to s + 2 kilometers per hour, the total time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, but the time spent in the coffee shop remains the same, which is t minutes.\n\nI need to find the time in minutes when her walking speed is s + 1/2 km/h.\n\nLet me try to model this.\n\nFirst, when her speed is s km/h, the time taken for the walk is 4 hours. But wait, the walk itself is 9 km. So if her walking speed is s km/h, the time she would take to walk 9 km without stopping would be distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours.\n\nBut in this case, she stops at a coffee shop after walking some distance, which takes her t minutes. So the total time given is the time walking plus the time in the coffee shop.\n\nSo perhaps the total time when walking at s km/h is (9/s) hours plus t minutes.\n\nSimilarly, when her speed increases to s + 2 km/h, the time walking would be 9/(s + 2) hours, and then plus t minutes.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that in both cases, the total time includes the same t minutes in the coffee shop.\n\nSo perhaps the key here is that the time in the coffee shop is the same in both scenarios.\n\nSo let's denote:\n\nWhen speed is s km/h:\n\nTotal time = time walking + time in coffee shop.\n\nBut wait, actually, perhaps the total time given is the time walking plus the time in the coffee shop.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nWhen walking at s km/h:\n\nTime walking + time in coffee shop = total time.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the total time given is the time walking plus the time in the coffee shop.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nWhen walking at s km/h:\n\nTime walking (which is distance/speed) + time in coffee shop (t minutes) = total time (4 hours).\n\nSimilarly, when walking at s + 2 km/h:\n\nTime walking (9/(s + 2)) + t = total time (2 hours 24 minutes).\n\nSo perhaps I can set up two equations here.\n\nFirst, let's convert all times into hours because the speed is in km/h.\n\nSo total time when walking at s km/h is 4 hours.\n\nSo time walking is 9/s hours, plus time in coffee shop t minutes converted into hours.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the total time given is the time walking plus the time in the coffee shop.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nWhen walking at s km/h:\n\nTime walking (9/s hours) + time in coffee shop (t minutes converted to hours) = total time (4 hours).\n\nSimilarly, when walking at s + 2 km/h:\n\nTime walking (9/(s + 2) hours) + time in coffee shop (t minutes converted to hours) = total time (2 hours 24 minutes).\n\nSo perhaps I can write:\n\nEquation 1: (9/s) + (t/60) = 4.\n\nEquation 2: (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = (2 + 24/60) hours.\n\nBecause 2 hours and 24 minutes is equal to 2 + 24/60 hours.\n\nSo let's compute that.\n\n24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours.\n\nSo total time in hours is 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours.\n\nTherefore, Equation 2 becomes:\n\n(9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) (9/s) + (t/60) = 4.\n\n2) (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4.\n\nWe can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate t/60.\n\nSo:\n\n[ (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) ] - [ (9/s) + (t/60) ] = 2.4 - 4.\n\nSimplify:\n\n9/(s + 2) - 9/s = -1.6.\n\nSo:\n\n9/(s + 2) - 9/s = -1.6.\n\nLet me factor out the 9:\n\n9[1/(s + 2) - 1/s] = -1.6.\n\nCompute the expression inside the brackets:\n\n1/(s + 2) - 1/s = [s - (s + 2)] / [s(s + 2)] = (-2)/(s(s + 2)).\n\nTherefore:\n\n9*(-2)/(s(s + 2)) = -1.6.\n\nSimplify:\n\n-18/(s(s + 2)) = -1.6.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6.\n\nSo:\n\n18/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2).\n\nCompute 1.6 * s(s + 2):\n\n1.6 * s^2 + 1.6 * 2s = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s.\n\nSo:\n\n18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s.\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\n1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0.\n\nTo make it easier, perhaps multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimals:\n\n16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0.\n\nSimplify this quadratic equation.\n\nDivide all terms by 4:\n\n4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0.\n\nSo now, quadratic equation: 4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0.\n\nWe can solve this using quadratic formula.\n\nFor ax^2 + bx + c = 0, solution is x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)]/(2a).\n\nHere, a = 4, b = 8, c = -45.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\nb^2 - 4ac = 64 - 4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784.\n\nsqrt(784) = 28.\n\nTherefore, solutions:\n\ns = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (2*4) = [ -8 ± 28 ] / 8.\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\n1) (-8 + 28)/8 = (20)/8 = 2.5.\n\n2) (-8 -28)/8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5.\n\nSince speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nSo now, we have s = 2.5.\n\nNow, let's find t.\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\n(9/s) + (t/60) = 4.\n\nPlug in s = 2.5.\n\nCompute 9 / 2.5.\n\n9 / 2.5 = (9 * 2)/5 = 18/5 = 3.6.\n\nSo:\n\n3.6 + (t/60) = 4.\n\nTherefore, t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4.\n\nSo t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.\n\nSo now, we know that when walking at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.\n\nWe need to find the total time when walking at 3 km/h.\n\nTotal time = time walking + time in coffee shop.\n\nTime walking is distance/speed = 9 / 3 = 3 hours.\n\nTime in coffee shop is t minutes, which is 24 minutes.\n\nTherefore, total time in hours is 3 + (24/60) hours.\n\nConvert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours.\n\nSo total time in hours is 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours.\n\nConvert back to minutes: 3.4 * 60 = 204 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the walk takes 204 minutes when she walks at 3 km/h.\n\nLet me verify the calculations.\n\nFirst, when walking at s = 2.5 km/h:\n\nTime walking: 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours.\n\nTime in coffee shop: t = 24 minutes.\n\nTotal time given was 4 hours, which is 240 minutes.\n\nSo time walking (3.6 hours = 216 minutes) + time in coffee shop (24 minutes) = 240 minutes.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nWhen walking at s + 2 = 4.5 km/h:\n\nTime walking: 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours.\n\nTime in coffee shop: 24 minutes.\n\nTotal time given was 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 144 minutes.\n\nSo time walking (120 minutes) + time in coffee shop (24 minutes) = 144 minutes.\n\nYes, that also checks out.\n\nTherefore, when walking at s + 0.5 = 3 km/h:\n\nTime walking: 9 / 3 = 3 hours.\n\nTime in coffee shop: 24 minutes.\n\nTotal time in minutes: (3 * 60) + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nSo the answer is 204 minutes.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe walk takes her \\boxed{204} minutes.\n</think>\n\nAya walks 9 kilometers every morning and stops at a coffee shop.
